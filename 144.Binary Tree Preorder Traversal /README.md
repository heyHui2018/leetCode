## Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

### 题目
Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Input: root = []
Output: []

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]

Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
