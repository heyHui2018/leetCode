## Max Points on a Line

### 题目
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, 
return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

Example:
```
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3

Input: points = [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]
Output: 4
```

Constraints:
* 1 <= points.length <= 300
* points[i].length == 2
* -104 <= xi, yi <= 104
* All the points are unique.
