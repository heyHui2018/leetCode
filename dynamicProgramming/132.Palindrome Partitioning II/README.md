## Palindrome Partitioning

### 题目
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.

Example:
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.

Input: s = "a"
Output: 0

Input: s = "ab"
Output: 1
```

Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 2000
* s contains only lowercase English letters.
